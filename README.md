# Optimizing-Support-Vector-Machines-for-Purchase-Prediction

- Trained Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with linear, radial, and polynomial kernels on the OJ dataset.
- Evaluated training and test error rates for each SVM model and identified optimal cost values.
- Concluded that the linear SVM approach yielded the best results for purchase prediction in the dataset.
